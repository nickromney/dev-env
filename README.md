# My Development Vagrant Box

This repository has two main components:

### Vagrant
* For booting a base virtual machine from Vagrant Cloud.

### Ansible
* For provisioning the machine.

I use Vagrant to boot a base box from Vagrant Cloud, and provision it using the Ansible roles in this project. The roles used are dependent upon the operating system of the guest machine.

### Currently supported operating systems
* _Centos 7_
* _Ubuntu 16.04_
* _Ubuntu 18.04_
* _Ubuntu 20.04_
* _Arch Linux_

## Dependencies
* [__VirtualBox (version 6.0.4)__](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [__vagrant (version 2.2.3)__](https://www.vagrantup.com)
* __vagrant-vbguest__ (optional, but recommended) - run ```vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest```
    * This automatically mounts the latest VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest system, if it is not already mounted.
    * Optional, but if you do not want to use it, you need to install the Guest Additions manually, and make sure you keep up to date with its newest releases.
    * See the [vagrant-vbguest github repository](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) for more details on this plugin.

## Installation
### Using the base box, and provisioning on boot:
```git clone https://github.com/mattladany/dev-env.git```

```cd dev-env```

```vagrant up```

## Configuration
To configure the operationg system you want to use, set the 'BOX_NAME' variable in the Vagrantfile to one of the following strings:
* "centos/7"
* "ubuntu/xenial64"
* "ubuntu/bionic64"
* "ubuntu/focal64" (default)
* "archlinux/archlinux"

Visit [Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search) for more information.

## Notes
* __VirtualBox Guest Additions Bug__
    * Currently, the VirtualBox Guest Additions has a bug where immediately after logging in, windowing features do not work correctly and you will have trouble clicking around once an application is opened. As a current workaround, you need to log out and log back in immediately after booting. Will continue to look into this until a fix is found.

## To Do's
* Add macOS as a possible OS to use.
* Continue to add wanted packages to all boxes.
* Make the desktop environment configurable.
* Remove the vagrant-vbguest plugin dependency, and mount the VirtualBox Guest Additions manually.
* Add boxes to Vagrant Cloud once they are stable.
* Test the installation on host machines other than MacOS.
